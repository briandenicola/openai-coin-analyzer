# Overview
This project is a demonstration on how to use Azure OpenAI. It takes an uploaded image of a Roman Imperial Coin and analyzes it Azure OpenAI
using the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview?tabs=python) and the 'gpt-4-turbo' model. The application is built using a microservices architecture and deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) for the front end.

## Design Questions and Challenges
* :question: What are some ways to improve the performance of the application?
* :question: How can we ensure the security of the application?
* :question: Azure WAF for AI applications recommends placing an Azure API Management (APIM) in front of the Azure OpenAI Service. How can we implement this - should this differ than the current APIM deployed?
* :question: Calls to Azure OpenAI can take a long time to process. How can we leverage other services such as Azure WebPub improve responsiveness of the application?

# Setup
* The environment can setup following the steps in the [Setup and Deployment](./docs/setup.md) document.  
* The setup process will create all the required resources and deploy the application code to Azure.
