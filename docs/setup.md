## Codespaces
> You can use the following link to launch a Codespaces configured for this project:

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/briandenicola/openai-coin-analyzer)  

## Prerequisites
* A Posix compliant System. It could be one of the following:
    * [Github CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
    * Azure Linux VM - Standard_B1s VM will work ($18/month)
    * Windows 11 with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [dotnet 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - The .NET Platform
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio).com/) or equivalent - A lightweight code editor
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - The Docker Desktop to build/push containers
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) - A tool for managing Azure resources
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) - The source control tool
* [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) - A task runner for the shell
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - A tool for building Azure infrastructure and infrastructure as code

## DNS Records
* The following DNS records are required for the application to work correctly.  These are used for the application to be accessed externally.  
* You must own a domain where you have the ability create DNS records.
* The following records are required __replace bjd.demo with your domain name__: 
    Name | Usage | DNS Record Type | IP Address
    ------ | ---- | ---- | ----
    ric.bjd.demo | APIM Gateway | A | APIM Gateway IP Address in West US

## Required Certificates
* The Azure Service Mesh has an External Gateway and requires a TLS Certificate. 
* [This guide](./docs/letsencrypt.md) will walk you through Let's Encrypt with Azure DNS

## Task
* The deployment of this application has been automated using [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/).  This was done instead of using a CI/CD pipeline to make it easier to understand the deployment process.  
* Of course, the application can be deployed manually
* The Taskfile is a simple way to run commands and scripts in a consistent manner.  
* The [Taskfile](../Taskfile.yaml) definition is located in the root of the repository
* The Task file declares the default values that can be updated to suit specific requirements: 

### Taskfile Variables

Name | Usage | Location | Required | Default or Example Value
------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
TITLE | Value used in Azure Tags | taskfile.yaml | Yes | Roman Imperial Coin Analyzer
DEFAULT_REGION | Default region to deploy to | taskfile.yaml | Yes | canadacentral
DEFAULT_DOMAIN | Default domain used for all URLs & certs | taskfile.yaml | Yes | bjd.demo
COUNT | Number of replicas for the application | taskfile.yaml | No | 2
HELM_CHART | Helm Chart to use for deployment | taskfile.yaml | No | ric-analyzer
SKU | SKU for the nodes in AKS | taskfile.yaml | No | Standard_D4ads_v5

### Task Commands
* Running the `task` command without any options will run the default command. This will list all the available tasks.
