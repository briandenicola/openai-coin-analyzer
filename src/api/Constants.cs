    # Common Coin Denominations:
    ## Solidus
    * Made of 24 carat gold. 
    * It weighs about 4.5 grams 
    * Brought in circulation by Constantine the Great around 310 AD.  
    * In earlier times it was called an Aureus, which with its 8 grams was notably heavier.

    ##Denarius 
    * Made of silver. 
    * It weighed around 4.5 grams during the time of Commodus but dwindled down to a meager 3 grams until it was abolished during Diocletian's reign. 
    * At first it had a value of 25 against one Aureus. But around 350AD it had a value of 3.6 million against one Solidus.

    ## Antonius
    * Also made of  silver. 
    * It is the successor of the Denarius. 
    * Caracalla brought it into circulation in 215AD.
    * The coin is easily recognizable because an Emperor wears a radiate crown on his head and an Emperor's shoulders are adorned with crescents.
    * At one point it was plated in silver and was required to have a minimal content of silver, because of this it is also called a silvered Antoninus. 

    ## Sestertius 
    * Made of bronze.
    * With its average diameter of 30 mm (in the 1st century even 35 mm) and weight of 25 grams it is the biggest of the Roman coins. 
    * After 275 (with Aurelius as Emperor) the coin was abolished. 
            
    ## Dupondius 
    * Made of brass. 
    * It has a diameter of 27 mm and weighs 15 grams. 
    * It had a value 1/2 a Sestertius or 2 Asses. 
    * It is usually recognizable by it's radiate crown on the Emperor or crescents on the shoulders of the Empress. 
    * It disappeared under the reign of Emperor Diocletian.

    ## As
    * Made of copper
    * Has a diameter of 27 mm and weighs about 9-12 grams.  
    * Its value was 1/4 Sestertius. 
    * It can be differentiated from the Dupondius because its lack of radiate crown or crescents. 
    * The As was abolished under Emperor Diocletian.

    ## Follis
    * Made of copper. 
    * These coins were initially covered in a thin layer of silver, which mostly have disappeared over time,
    * Originally the Follis was valued at 12.5 Denarii, later it was valued at 25 Denarii. 
    * In 346 the coin was abolished.
